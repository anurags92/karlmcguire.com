Bureaucratic irony is something I've noticed in large organizations with poor bottom-up communication.
It has actually become somewhat amusing to watch.

**Bureacratic irony is when the vision of an organization sounds good on paper,
but in the top-down application of the vision,
the focus becomes less about the vision
and more about specific actions/KPIs,
leading to poor results and epic failure.**

I noticed this the other day in one of my classes.
We were required to fill out a template-style essay about *our personality type* to "differentiate" ourselves on LinkedIn.
I physically cringed when I clicked "post" just to get the grade.
(I wonder if I can delete it now?)

This is a perfect example of bureaucratic irony in action.
The vision of the university is probably something like "prepare students for their career."
The vision makes sense, right? 
It sounds good on paper.

Moving down the organization the vision becomes "teach students how to use LinkedIn."
This also makes sense, though you can see how it's starting to deform.

And by the time you get to the lowest levels, where the students are, the vision becomes "fill out this template-style essay about your personality type and post it on your professional LinkedIn."
The result of this (damaging our LinkedIn brands) contradicts the vision.
This information isn't communicated up the ladder.

The information not communicated up the ladder builds up.
The bureaucratic irony can only get so ironic.
Eventually things start to explode.

I don't know about you, but these gaping inefficiencies excite me.
**Bureaucratic irony shows a distinct disconnect from reality,
which is opportunity.**

It's the responsibility of small, innovative teams to make big organizations feel the pain of bureacratic irony.
You do that by moving fast, [prioritizing trust](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html), and always [facing reality](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312517120198/d373368dex991.htm).
