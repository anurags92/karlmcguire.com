Project52 is something I conjured up a few days ago in a fit of boredom.

I realized that I have a *lot* of things I want to make.
So many that **when I work on a big project, I often jump ship to the next one without seeing if it would get any traction.** 
(Yes, this is [a bad habit](https://karlmcguire.com/the-timid-innovation-cycle/) I'm trying to break.) 
Project52 is a container that will allow me to code and innovate without fear of failure.

### Here's how it works:

1. 52 projects from 10/01/17 to 10/01/18
2. No more than 7 days per project
3. Each project must provide value to some group of people

And that's all there is to it.

At the end of each week I'll post a write up of what I did that week. 
The level of detail may vary, but I'll try to give day-by-day snapshots.
