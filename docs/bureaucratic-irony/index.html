		<p>Bureaucratic irony is something I&rsquo;ve noticed in large organizations with poor bottom-up communication.
It has actually become somewhat amusing to watch.</p>

<p><strong>Bureacratic irony is when the vision of an organization sounds good on paper,
but in the top-down application of the vision,
the focus becomes less about the vision
and more about specific actions/KPIs,
leading to poor results and epic failure.</strong></p>

<p>I noticed this the other day in one of my classes.
We were required to fill out a template-style essay about <em>our personality type</em> to &ldquo;differentiate&rdquo; ourselves on LinkedIn.
I physically cringed when I clicked &ldquo;post&rdquo; just to get the grade.
(I wonder if I can delete it now?)</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of bureaucratic irony in action.
The vision of the university is probably something like &ldquo;prepare students for their career.&rdquo;
The vision makes sense, right?
It sounds good on paper.</p>

<p>Moving down the organization the vision becomes &ldquo;teach students how to use LinkedIn.&rdquo;
This also makes sense, though you can see how it&rsquo;s starting to deform.</p>

<p>And by the time you get to the lowest levels, where the students are, the vision becomes &ldquo;fill out this template-style essay about your personality type and post it on your professional LinkedIn.&rdquo;
The result of this (damaging our LinkedIn brands) contradicts the vision.
This information isn&rsquo;t communicated up the ladder.</p>

<p>The information not communicated up the ladder builds up.
The bureaucratic irony can only get so ironic.
Eventually things start to explode.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but these gaping inefficiencies excite me.
<strong>Bureaucratic irony shows a distinct disconnect from reality,
which is opportunity.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the responsibility of small, innovative teams to make big organizations feel the pain of bureacratic irony.
You do that by moving fast, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html">prioritizing trust</a>, and always <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312517120198/d373368dex991.htm">facing reality</a>.</p>
